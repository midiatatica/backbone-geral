<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">BETWEEN THE ANTISPECTACLE AND
THE SEMIOTIC ARRAST&Atilde;O</span><br>
Por Ricardo Rosas<br>
<br>
How can one define a show which is not really a show, or a TV show that<br>
is not really a TV show? What should one do when the usual criteria for<br>
reviewing performances or videos fall into a vacuum in which references<br>
no longer exist, and the work to be reviewed goes against basic premises<br>
of these media?<br>
<br>
Upon watching pieces such as Futebol by Frente 3 de Fevereiro, or the<br>
series of shows produced by the A Revolu&ccedil;&atilde;o N&atilde;o
Ser&aacute; Televisionada<br>
(ARNSTV) collective, unsuspecting spectators and art critics might face<br>
dilemmas such as those. Preconceived notions might be defied. How can<br>
one describe the act of reciting Hermes Trismegistus while attached to a<br>
drawbridge, thus drawing the attention of local policemen, or creating a<br>
&#8220;virtual bridge&#8221; (with laser beam) to connect a favela to the financial<br>
heart of S&atilde;o Paulo, or Bahia de Todos os Santos to Africa, or
else<br>
&#8220;promoting&#8221; an arrast&atilde;o in Rio de Janeiro... featuring an
all-White<br>
'cast'?<br>
<br>
Perhaps a good clue for understanding this jigsaw of contradictory<br>
cross-references is the fact that artist Daniel Lima is involved in all<br>
of the aforementioned collectives and actions. Whether as a member of<br>
various art collectives, media artist, or urban interventionist, Lima<br>
has developed a taste for contradicting preconceived notions regarding<br>
art categories, as well as for putting his finger into open wounds of<br>
the urban social tissue. Lima's willingness to see beyond outward<br>
appearances, or to subvert them, is present even in his more politically<br>
tinged work, in which that very tinge is sometimes put in doubt or<br>
approached with an ironic twist.<br>
<br>
But then again, we no longer live in an age of absolute certainties. The<br>
&#8220;great narratives&#8221; have already been put aside, or at least partially<br>
discredited; major trends in cultural studies, from postcolonialism to<br>
deconstructivism, have brought down a whole bunch of once-sacred<br>
paradigms and axioms in various fields of knowledge; and even Identity,<br>
that great refuge, is currently surrounded by Post-Identity movements<br>
led by the same minorities which only a few decades ago would defend it<br>
as our sole hope of salvation; in that light, Daniel Lima's questionings<br>
are not altogether surprising.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, the &#8220;big issues&#8221; and open wounds still persist. Issues<br>
such as social inequality, racism, homelessness, corporate media<br>
domination, and so on are still valid, and Lima deals with them all. But<br>
his approach is not that of self-victimization or of the old and<br>
worn-out &#8220;cry against oppressors.&#8221; Neither does he blindly defend some<br>
assumed identity, whether racial (1) or otherwise, but rather, he does<br>
small tactical insertions, or &#8220;scams,&#8221; as Michel De Certeau would put<br>
it, which, instead of promoting clear confrontation or antagonism<br>
against an enemy, attack by surprise, using cleverness, opportunism, and<br>
the distraction of the stronger ones (2). Opp-art-unism.<br>
<br>
It is in these sometimes subtle, sometimes overt<br>
interferences/attritions that one may notice a certain playfulness as<br>
Lima messes around with codes, subverts them, or even &#8220;kidnaps&#8221; them by<br>
dealing with language in certain ways, characterized by violations of<br>
established protocols for presentation, whether in a public screening,<br>
in the formatting of a TV show, or in an urban intervention. I would<br>
like to point out two particular aspects of this subversion of the<br>
codes.<br>
<br>
For starters, there is a certain ambiguous fascination with the<br>
spectacle which, if on the one hand may leave the unwarned in doubt and<br>
eager to criticize a presumed glamorization of political criticism, the<br>
existence of vacuums, indifference, or fetishization, on the other hand<br>
does nothing to hide incongruence, noise, and dissonance which are<br>
themselves the richest and most revealing aspects of what Lima and his<br>
groups refer to as &#8220;antispectacle.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The phenomenon of the &#8220;spectacle&#8221; had already been analyzed by Guy<br>
Debord in his book The Society of the Spectacle, an essential book for<br>
understanding current beliefs with regard to the invasive omnipresence<br>
of media in our lives. The &#8220;antispectacle&#8221; in itself is not some veiled<br>
reference to Debord's ideas, but rather a bold attempt at using the<br>
entertainment media to disseminate subversive ideas, and not by chance,<br>
Debord will be overtly quoted in the first antispectacle action to be<br>
carried out by a collective of which Lima is a member, the
Revolu&ccedil;&atilde;o<br>
(ARNSTV) (3), in SESC Pomp&eacute;ia's Territ&oacute;rio de
Antiespet&aacute;culo at the<br>
Latinidades festival in 2003; the festival was an antishow in two parts<br>
over the course of two days, packed with group presentations, lectures,<br>
interruptions for Q&amp;A sessions, hip-hop actions, independent media<br>
images, and VJ performances. The framework, as one would expect, is that<br>
of the paradox, for even the videos featuring the actions-such as<br>
Liberte-se, jointly produced with the Companhia Cachorra collective-are<br>
ambiguous with regard to the actions themselves. In this particular<br>
case, the ambiguousness stems from selling empty bullet shells with the<br>
inscription &#8220;liberte-se&#8221; [&#8220;free yourself&#8221;]; from asking questions about<br>
the slogan to people waiting at stop signs, or still from burning the<br>
banners with the slogan and throwing away the cardboard signs. What is<br>
the point of subversion, after all? Is there a point? Or are these<br>
groups interested in the question itself?<br>
<br>
Perhaps a previous action, promoted by the collective during the
M&iacute;dia<br>
T&aacute;tica Brasil festival in March 2003, might be helpful in
understanding<br>
those ambiguous attitudes. During the action, ARNSTV took over a room at<br>
Casa das Rosas and filled it with life-sized cardboard reproductions of<br>
media celebrities, of the kind used for newsstand merchandising; during<br>
the festival, the reproductions stood with their back to those people<br>
who entered the room (depicting celebrities as they &#8220;actually&#8221; are:<br>
cardboard pictures, mere surfaces). Afterwards, the members of the<br>
collective went out in a procession, each of them tenderly carrying<br>
his/her own model as they walked around the city, went into shopping<br>
malls, stores, the subway, banks, etc., and then, in a grand finale,<br>
burnt the cardboard celebrities right in the middle of Avenida Paulista.<br>
This coupling of entertainment and social critique is the perfect<br>
synthesis of the notion of antispectacle.<br>
<br>
For some time now, even the most radical activist movements have been<br>
trying to &#8220;learn from Las Vegas.&#8221; As Andrew Boyd and Stephen Duncomb<br>
have put it in a text about how the contemporary left-wing can perfect<br>
its tactics by borrowing from the industry of the spectacle (4),<br>
contemporary movements should &#8220;learn how to use spectacle as a tool for<br>
political communication-not against their own will, but enthusiastically<br>
and guiltlessly.&#8221; But isn't it true that ever since the post-WWII<br>
period, predecessors such as the situationists, with their theory of<br>
d&eacute;tournement (or deviation), have plagiarized comic books and
Western<br>
movies, while yippie buffoons such as Abbie Hoffman or Jerry Rubin put<br>
their deep knowledge of the inner workings of media to their own use?<br>
Even a guru of the new movements such as Hakim Bey has already taught us<br>
how to learn from postmodernity in order to subvert it. TAZ, with its<br>
quotation fever, is a postmodern subversive theory to the core, although<br>
its essence may contradict the neoliberal foundation of postmodernism<br>
itself. An example of subversive action within the society of spectacle<br>
is that of culture-jammers, who use the language of that very society to<br>
sabotage advertising messages, altering their meanings with<br>
more-than-perfect layouts. Perhaps the notion of antispectacle lies<br>
precisely in one such assault to a media format, filling it up with<br>
meaningful noise and messages that flip script on the entertainment<br>
industry.<br>
<br>
Later actions by Lima and the collectives of which he was a member would<br>
continue to perfect the format. For example: in the Zona de
A&ccedil;&atilde;o<br>
festival, 2004, created by Lima himself, several groups did<br>
interventions in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, among them the
aforementioned<br>
ARNSTV and the antiracist activist collective Frente 3 de Fevereiro, in<br>
which Lima also takes part. The festival wrap-up was an antispectacular<br>
grand finale-a cathartic &#8220;anticelebration&#8221; of the murder of young<br>
Afro-descendant lawyer Fl&aacute;vio Sant'Ana by the S&atilde;o Paulo
Military<br>
Police-during which the crime was staged, and many different actions of<br>
the collectives around the city were screened. A remix of that format<br>
took place at the 8th Havana Biennial, near the end of 2003. The<br>
presentation of the Sem Sa&iacute;da series, replete with hip-hop and
videos,<br>
celebrated an action in which Lima trapped security guards into a Havana<br>
city square using chains and locks, thus forcing them to find an &#8220;escape<br>
point&#8221; out of the place. The action, with its tension-riddled discussion<br>
of the Cuban situation, the ever-present interpretative ambiguities, and<br>
its uninhibited screening just a few hours after it took place, was yet<br>
another antispectacle to establish a direct conversation with the local<br>
audience.<br>
<br>
The most recent antispectacle known to us was Futebol, carried out by<br>
Frente 3 de Fevereiro at the last Videobrasil Festival in September<br>
2005. Of all previous works, Futebol is perhaps the one that best<br>
epitomizes the conflicting aspects of the antispectacle concept. Taken<br>
at face value, the antispectacle is not intended to entertain, but<br>
rather to bother, or at least convey that uncomfortable feeling of<br>
detachment Brecht used to aim for with his theater. Well, Futebol sure<br>
is bothersome, as it puts a finger into open wounds with regard to the<br>
formation of Brazil, but at the same time it has rhythm, it &#8220;goes with<br>
the flow,&#8221; and it entertains. Once again, the ambiguities are there. Let<br>
us not be fooled: the issue is serious and very real, after all, is<br>
there racial democracy in Brazil? What about identity, is there any?<br>
&#8220;What is your identity?&#8221; If, on the one hand, a hip-hop vibe provides<br>
the soundtrack for MC Roberta Estrela D'Alva's fascinating &#8220;Socratic<br>
monologue,&#8221; with her deep questioning of Brazilian History, on the other<br>
hand lies the image remix of the mass media, of TV newscasts, of<br>
newspapers, and of recent racist episodes involving soccer celebrities,<br>
as opinions are voiced amidst a roller coaster of loops, repetitions,<br>
samplings, all of which with an added twist of doubt, irony, and<br>
questioning. Can we really think of Futebol as a spectacle? What about<br>
its more incisive passages, such as the surgically precise questions<br>
about our architecture, pointing to the fact that the contemporary<br>
maid's room is a leftover from slavery, or the semiotic<br>
&#8220;flash-kidnappings&#8221; in which huge banners with phrases such as &#8220;Onde<br>
Est&atilde;o os Negros?&#8221; [&#8220;Where Are the Black Men?&#8221;] were shown during<br>
mainstream media soccer match broadcasts?<br>
<br>
If the antispectacle is partly defined by ambiguity itself and the noise<br>
that sets it apart from a conventional, entertainment-oriented<br>
spectacle, then these symbolic scratches (5)-true &#8220;flash-kidnappings&#8221; of<br>
media attention by means of instant, hit-and-run banner flashing in<br>
soccer stadiums-are another important element for understanding how<br>
codes are subverted in Daniel Lima's individual and collective work.<br>
<br>
The aforementioned element is Lima's reverse, inverted use of signs,<br>
these symbolic conventions that surround us, as he takes them by storm<br>
and turns them around in what I shall call &#8220;semiotic arrast&atilde;o.&#8221;
The<br>
image of the arrast&atilde;o came from an intervention of the same name
that<br>
was presented by Lima at the Prog: Me new media festival in Rio de<br>
Janeiro, 2005. Given the curators' concern that there might be problems<br>
with people on the beach if Black men were to simulate an
arrast&atilde;o, Lima<br>
chose the racially &#8220;opposite&#8221; path: a &#8220;blond arrast&atilde;o.&#8221; He
intended to<br>
lay bare a subliminal premise involved in this process: thirty Black men<br>
cannot walk together in Ipanema, but thirty blond men can. In other<br>
words, the image of the arrast&atilde;o is clearly linked to that of
the poor<br>
Black man.<br>
<br>
When it comes to signs, one need not go too far to realize where the<br>
image of the Black man (or that of ethnic groups other than the White<br>
one) lies within the symbolic hierarchy of our society. Lima himself<br>
comes from that ethnic group, and as we have seen previously, his work<br>
often discusses racial issues and the social divides that they create.<br>
This, of course, does not rule out the confusing ambiguity and<br>
self-irony, detached from any kind of fixed identity. One such example<br>
is the Blitz photography series, which runs counter to the critical<br>
tinge of Zona de A&ccedil;&atilde;o, which dealt with police racism;
here, Lima smiles<br>
as he greets policemen in pictures so harmless that they were even<br>
displayed in front of the 7th Battalion of Military Police in
S&atilde;o Paulo.<br>
But the half-smile of a Black citizen might hide a certain irony, as he<br>
shakes hands with policemen notorious for their violence against Black<br>
people, in such a way that overidentification itself becomes a source of<br>
doubt.<br>
<br>
But let's get back to the arrast&atilde;o. It was musician Tom
Z&eacute; who first<br>
came up with the concept of arrast&atilde;o as a cultural practice,
through the<br>
aesthetics of appropriation, the idea of creation through<br>
&#8220;plagiarism-combination.&#8221; This &#8220;urban theft technique,&#8221; as Tom Z&eacute;<br>
himself put it in the booklet of the Com Defeito de
Fabrica&ccedil;&atilde;o CD-in<br>
which &#8220;a small group runs wild through a crowd, 'sweeping away' money,<br>
rings, purses, and even people's clothes&#8221; (6)-is a metaphor for an<br>
appropriative and even invasive approach towards artistic creation, one<br>
that is uninhibited regarding established codes and discourses.<br>
According to American theoretician Christopher Dunn, who studies the<br>
Tropic&aacute;lia, &#8220;given the present-day framework of neoliberal<br>
globalization, creation through arrast&atilde;o can also be an act of
violence,<br>
subversion, or even resistance.&#8221; (7) Dunn believes that the
arrast&atilde;o is<br>
a contemporary equivalent of anthropophagy in past times, since these<br>
creators &#8220;attack the cultural legacy from which they are excluded,&#8221; in<br>
addition to the fact that the arrast&atilde;o metaphor &#8220;is an explicit<br>
reference to the socially underprivileged.&#8221; (8) Lima, for instance,<br>
promotes a sort of &#8220;semiotic arrast&atilde;o&#8221; in which current codes
and signs<br>
are taken, meanings are reversed, and the original messages are inverted<br>
or mixed up with noise and short-circuited. Here the term semiotic is<br>
not as much a reference to Pierce or Greimas' science of language<br>
analysis as it is to the polissemic possibility of relating content<br>
systems to expression systems (9). The concept relates to Umberto Eco's<br>
&#8220;semiological guerilla&#8221; as well, as it aims at reintroducing a critical<br>
dimension to the relationship with the media, and deals with ambiguous<br>
codes in aesthetic communication or mass communication (10). Another<br>
reference is what Franco &#8220;Bifo&#8221; Berardi calls &#8220;semiocapital&#8221;: the<br>
semiotic capital, another word for the capital of immaterial work, the<br>
&#8220;economy of knowledge&#8221; that is laying the foundation of contemporary<br>
globalized economy, according to theoreticians such as Michael Hardt and<br>
Antonio Negri, the authors of Empire and Multitude. As Bifo puts it,<br>
&#8220;the deepest running process that began in the 1990's is the full-blown<br>
interaction between the economic and semiotic systems, the full<br>
integration of productive work and semiotic production. Essentially,<br>
globalization consists of this integration.&#8221; (11)<br>
<br>
In such a scenario, where the signs themselves-language according to<br>
philosopher Paolo Virno-have become the driving force behind economy,<br>
the image of a semiotic arrast&atilde;o, or even that of a symbolic<br>
&#8220;flash-kidnapping&#8221; as a subversive or antagonistic practice, may not<br>
seem so strange. This type of practice was already present in one of<br>
Lima's first efforts, small actions of poetic terrorism where he would<br>
alter or replace stickers in subway stairs; what once read:
&#8220;ATEN&Ccedil;&Atilde;O!<br>
Segure-se sempre aos corrim&atilde;os&#8221; [&#8220;ATTENTION! Always hold on to
the stair<br>
rails&#8221;] or &#8220;ATEN&Ccedil;&Atilde;O! Segure as crian&ccedil;as pelas
m&atilde;os&#8221; [&#8220;ATTENTION! Hold<br>
the children by the hand&#8221;], Lima would place stickers with the message<br>
&#8220;ATEN&Ccedil;&Atilde;O! Segure sempre a minha m&atilde;o&#8221; [&#8220;ATTENTION!
Always hold my hand&#8221;].<br>
Other examples were his transpositions from graffiti to laser beams in<br>
Scribe and Picha&ccedil;&atilde;o Laser, in his &#8220;virtual bridges,&#8221; also
made out of<br>
laser, connecting impoverished neighborhoods to affluent areas of
S&atilde;o<br>
Paulo, or Salvador to Africa, and when he hung from a moving drawbridge<br>
in Rotterdam while reciting verses from Jorge Ben's Hermes Trimegisto<br>
[Hermes Trismegistus], thus attracting the attention of the Dutch<br>
police. Another example was the arresting of those who had the power to<br>
arrest, the security guards, in the aforementioned action in Havana,<br>
Cuba.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the act of comparing the work of Daniel Lima to an
arrast&atilde;o<br>
is an allusion to his attitude regarding valid codes, his violence which<br>
is nearly &#8220;terrorist,&#8221; or better yet &#8220;disobedient,&#8221; to use a well-liked<br>
term in contemporary activist movements, since what one does in the<br>
semiotic realm is not properly illegal or illicit, but rather an<br>
appropriative arrast&atilde;o that takes over a space, a sign, a
format, and<br>
then remodels it, inverting it in order to attain the desired effect.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most emblematic examples of semiotic arrast&atilde;o in
Lima's work<br>
are those he developed in A Revolu&ccedil;&atilde;o N&atilde;o
Ser&aacute; Televisionada. ARNSTV's<br>
pieces involve recycling, deviation, and altered plagiarism of various<br>
mass culture productions; its creations are collective efforts; its<br>
output features inverted and ambiguous signs; and, for the most part,<br>
the group's series consists of a true arrast&atilde;o of the signs
usually seen<br>
in television, media art, and video art, as well as in the pop culture<br>
dictated by MTV, among others.<br>
<br>
Initially screened in a paid public TV channel, TV USP, the eight<br>
episodes (as well as the following ones, either shorter or longer than<br>
the twenty-five-minute format of the series) began in 2002, designed as<br>
an &#8220;anti-TV show,&#8221; as the group described it (12). Featuring various<br>
artists and collectives, combining TV news, documentary films, and other<br>
images, to tell the story of an urban guerilla soldier experiencing an<br>
existential crisis, the series unfolds amidst quick cuts from scene to<br>
scene, surreal experimental production, and a sometimes distorted, scary<br>
voice in off, making for some clearly paranoid moments.<br>
<br>
The sign-inversion begins with the fact that the series was made for TV<br>
and got screened in a paid TV channel, while the collective's name,<br>
taken from a Gil Scott-Heron song, states that the revolution will not<br>
be televised. On the other hand, since the group was inspired, as they<br>
claimed in an interview (13), by graffiti artists and by the urban<br>
cultural guerilla, their intention is clearly that of interfering with<br>
TV media. ARNSTV's unabashed artistic experimentalism would never fit<br>
into an open TV channel, since they stray too far from the commercial,<br>
&#8220;utilitarian&#8221; framework of that format. Their undeniable political<br>
inclination, on the other hand, makes their show unfit for a channel<br>
such as MTV, which did not show any interest in broadcasting the series.<br>
Finally, the rapid, quick cutting, highly professional editing (very<br>
similar to MTV's own editing style), the thoroughly pop, well-finished,<br>
TV-series-type aesthetic also sets the show apart from the video art<br>
realm as we usually know it (14). The shamelessness in being narrative<br>
and pop-esque, as well as the groundbreaking experimentation with video<br>
and politics in Brazil, a country where there is no such tradition,<br>
characterize ARNSTV's series as a unique creation within the Brazilian<br>
audiovisual scene.<br>
<br>
This hybridism-or boldness-in combining intervention, video, poetic<br>
terrorism, and the TV format might make it hard to understand the<br>
creation in a traditional manner. From the perspective of less<br>
conventional theories, such as tactical media according to David Garcia<br>
and Geert Lovink (15), ARNSTV's episodes (such as, for example, the<br>
Pernambuco-based VJs of the Media Sana collective) are not exactly<br>
antagonistic, but shocking nevertheless in media terms, and therefore<br>
probably figure among the most significant examples of tactical media<br>
ever produced in Brazil.<br>
<br>
The contradictions and ambiguities remain. The ideals for which they<br>
stand are not so clearly defined, but is this all about ideals or the<br>
way in which they are conveyed? How can one defend cultural guerilla,<br>
and yet produce a series for paid TV? Those very paradoxes make Daniel<br>
Lima's creations both rich and problematic. Without the paradoxes, we<br>
would not understand Lima. When questioned if they feared being<br>
swallowed by the voracious entertainment industry, the ARNSTV members<br>
replied: &#8220;Let them swallow us, get sick, throw up.&#8221; Not by chance, one<br>
of the series' iconic scenes would never make it into a TV Globo<br>
retrospective: yes, that &#8220;innocent&#8221; image of Xuxa doing her show when,<br>
in slow motion (courtesy of Revolu&ccedil;&atilde;o's editing), she
spots a fire in<br>
the set and runs away, the children run away, and the set burns. You<br>
name it: art, appropriation, activism, entertainment?<br>
