<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LANGUAGE OF TACTICAL MEDIA</span><br>
Por Joanne Richardson<br>
<br>
"World War III will be a guerilla information war,
with no division between military and civilian participation." -- motto
of Tactical Media Crew, borrowed from Marshall McLuhan<br>
<br>
The future is a series of small steps leading away
from the wreckage of the past, sometimes its actors walk face forward,
blind to the history played out behind their backs, other times, they
walk backwards, seeing only the unfulfilled destiny of a vanished time.
The promise of the tactical media of the future - the end of the
spectacular media circus as everyone begins to lay their hands on cheap
'do it yourself' media technologies made possible by new forms of
production and distribution - was inspired by a distinction between
tactics and strategies made by Michel de Certeau in 1974. Strategies,
which belong to states, economic power, and scientific rationality are
formed around a clear sense of boundary, a separation between the
proper place of the self and an outside defined as an enemy. Tactics
insinuate themselves into the other's place without the privilege of
separation; they are not a frontal assault on an external power, but
makeshift, temporary infiltrations from the inside through actions of
thefts, hijacks, tricks and pranks. But for de Certeau, the distinction
was almost entirely focused on the power of reading (the consumption of
signs) to transform submission into subversion. The most memorable
example of tactics in The Practice of Everyday Life is the indigenous
Indians who under Spanish colonization appear to be submissive but
really "often made of the rituals, representations, and laws imposed on
them something quite different from what their conquerors had in mind;
they subverted them not by rejecting or altering them, but by using
them with respect to ends and references foreign to the system they had
no choice but to accept." The apparently submissive kneel, bow down,
put their hands together in prayer, but they don't believe the words;
when they mouth them they secretly mean something that was not intended
by the original producers. The strength of their 'resistance' is in
their silent interpretations of these rituals, not in their
transformation.<br>
<br>
Maybe the most interesting thing about the theory of
tactical media is the extent to which it abandons rather than pays
homage to de Certeau, making tactics not a silent production by reading
signs without changing them, but outlining the way in which active
production can become tactical in contrast to strategic, mainstream
media. The examples of tactical media have almost become canonical by
now: billboard pirating by Adbusters, plagiarized websites by the
Italian hackers, 0100101110101101.org, RTMark's mock websites for G.W.
Bush and the World Trade Organization, and (as theYes Men) their
impersonations of WTO representatives to deliver messages that don't
challenge the WTO's position but over-identify with it to the point of
absurdity. In contrast to mainstream media, tactical interventions
don't occupy a stable ideological place from which they put forward
counter-arguments; they speak in tongues, offering temporary
revelations. But while shifting the emphasis from the consumption of
signs to an active form of media production, the theory of tactical
media seems to have lost some of the original contours of de Certeau's
distinction. The tactical media universe as mapped by David Garcia and
Geert Lovink in 'The ABC of Tactical Media' also included 'alternative'
media, although its logic seems quite different. Grassroots initiatives
which are focused on building a community around other values than the
mainstream, do occupy an ideological place that is marked as different;
they don't infiltrate the mainstream in order to pirate or detourn it,
as RTMark might infiltrate the media image of the WTO.<br>
<br>
And especially in the recent transformation of
alternative media into the global Indymedia network, the separation
between Indymedias' alternative voice and the mainstream enemy is quite
evident. Indymedia critiques the pretensions of mass media to be a
true, genuine, democratic form of representation; it opposes the false
media shell with counter-statements made from a counter-perspective - a
perspective that is not questioned because it is assumed as natural. My
Italian friends who work with Indymedia showed me a video they
co-produced about the anti-globalization demonstrations in Prague and
asked what I thought. I replied that it was a good piece of propaganda,
but as propaganda it never examined its own position. In this video you
see a lot of activists who came to Prague from America, UK,
Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, etc; occasionally you even get
ossified Leninist bullshit from members of communist parties. What you
really don't get is any reflection of the local Czech context - many
locals denounced what they saw as an attempt to playact a revolution by
foreigners who invoked slogans from an ideology the Czechs themselves
considered long obsolete. The confrontation of these different
perspectives is absent from the video, since it is meant to promote
Indymedia's own anarcho-communist position, raised to the level of a
universal truth. And in this sense it was as strategic and dogmatic as
mainstream media; it was only the content of its message that differed.<br>
<br>
De Certeau was a child of his time, maybe as a
former Jesuit he was more timid and better behaved than his siblings,
but he played with the same conceptual toys. In its historical moment
tactics was an important idea that sought to define a way of subverting
the information spectacle that would avoid using the same tools
(strategies) against its opponent. Tactics recycled the Situationist
idea of detournement: taking over the images and words from mass
culture, but putting them through an unexpected detour, using them in a
way they were not originally intended by combining them in surprising
combinations, heretical juxtapositions. The Lettrists kidnapped a
priest, and, dressed in his gown, gave a sermon at the Notre Dame on
the death of god; the SI altered the soundtracks of karate and porn
films to reflect the struggle against bureaucracy; even striking
workers during May '68 stole the media image of James Bond with a gun
for a poster announcing themselves as the new specter haunting the
world. These were neither art nor political speech; their disruptive
power was that they did not use the familiar, straightforward language
of politics. Their wit and lack of directness was a measure of their
success; the danger always lurking in the background was that this new
mode of production through theft and infiltration of public spaces,
including the media, could ultimately be used to deliver the same kind
of blunt, inflexible propaganda as the media spectacle. As a practice,
detournement reflected a contradiction between the recognition that
fighting on the same terrain as the enemy is a seductive but inevitable
trap, and the desire to occupy the buildings of power under a new name.
This contradiction crystallized in the hijacking metaphor: detourne was
a verb commonly used to describe the hijacking of a plane.<br>
<br>
The SI played upon this connotation, announcing
their own productions as hijackings - of films, of politics, of
quotidian desires. The terrorist as a symbolic equivalent of the
subversion of power was never far in the background of associations.
And in an almost straight line stretching across the precipice of
history, aesthetic terrorism continues to be invoked as an honorific
title. Etoy advertise themselves as 'digital terrorism'; in an
interview, Mark Dery called CAE a 'philosophical terrorist cell' and
made comparisons to the Red Brigades; RTMark is often congratulated for
its brand of 'media terrorism.' Now it could be lamented that an
unfortunate metaphor is being applied to practices that are very
different - but in what sense is the affinity only a matter of
metaphor? Terrorism is a way that the weak, lacking the strength in
numbers and political influence, can try to make use of the strong by
infiltrating their places of power, in the hope that the temporary
seizure of a key building, an airplane, or a politician might shift the
balance of things and bring power to the bargaining table. Ever since
terrorism abandoned the tradition of tyrannicide and became a form of
propaganda of the deed, it operated through a hijack of the media.
Letters to the press, communiqu&eacute;s: 5 minutes under the opaque
illumination of the media spotlight. The terrorist use of media hijacks
is the point where tactical media and strategy meet - it may be a
surprise infiltration rather than a direct attack, but an infiltration
with a clear sense of separation between its own position and that of
the enemy, an infiltration that ultimately mirrors the political
organization, juridical system and mode of expression of the power it
opposes. The Red Brigades' hierarchy of brigades, columns, national
branches, and an executive committee was a double of the centralist
organization of the state; the Weather Underground's
counter-institution of 'proletarian' justice mimicked the obscenity of
the law in reverse: "We now find the government guilty and sentence it
to death on the streets." And today's fundamentalist terrorism is a
mirror of the network society of a stateless, global capitalism.
Western educated bin Laden militants don't belong to any specific
country; they travel the globe from Bosnia to Paris and New York, use
the internet and cellular phones, and have access to communication
networks even in a desert cave.<br>
<br>
Asking how media can be used tactically today
implies a recognition of the contradictory history in which the idea
was born - the moment of crisis when new social forces rendered old
categories obsolete, and Marxism began to reveal itself as a bankrupt
system in which capitalism found not its abolition but its supreme
fulfillment. But alongside new ideas and the search for a new language,
lingered old modes of organization dating back to the Jacobin terror of
the French Revolution, and the mythic image of the armed, militant
hero. Tactics sought to express a new way that the weak could fight
against power by using different tools - but in the old language of
military engagement. Before de Certeau, the distinction between tactics
and strategy was invoked by Clausewitz in 1812. Tactics is the manner
of conducting each separate combat; strategy is the means of combining
individual combats to attain the general objective of the war. Tactics
is the deployment of individual parts, strategy, the overview of the
whole. This is a very different distinction from de Certeau's
opposition between modes of combat; de Certeau's tactics is closer to
what Clausewitz called strategem - a concealed, indirect movement which
doesn't actually deceive but provokes the enemy to commit errors of
understanding. This is analogous to what Sun Tzu termed a 'war of
maneuver' - an artifice of diversion undertaken by weak forces against
a large, well-organized opponent, an unexpected move that entices the
enemy, leading him to make mistakes, and eventually self-destruct.<br>
<br>
Whether direct or concealed, offensive or defensive,
using the strength of numbers or the artifice of diversion, both
strategy and tactics belong to the art of warfare and have the same
objectives: conquering the armed power of the enemy, taking possession
of his goods and other sources of strength, and gaining public opinion
by destroying the enemy's credibility. And perhaps this is the
limitation of a media theory based on a distinction between tactics and
strategies - ultimately both are a form of war against an enemy power.
The tactics of media hacks may differ from the strategy of independent,
alternative media in their formal aspects, but what seems common to
both is their self-definition through an act of opposition. A fake
GWBush page cannot exist without the authentic one, which it parodies.
Indymedia cannot exist without global capital, whose abuses it
chronicles, or without mainstream media, whose falsifications it
denounces. The mainstream also needs an embodiment of opposition to the
universal values of democracy, enlightened humanitarianism, and the
right to consume without restraint. And after the collapse of the other
of 'Eastern Europe,' the image of the terrorist is now the perfect
media fantasy, the face against which it can define its own values in
reverse.<br>
<br>
This reflection was occasioned by my editorial
participation in the 4th Next 5 Minutes Festival; it's an attempt to
think about its content, which proposes an investigation of the meaning
of tactical media in the wake of September 11, and its decentralized
organizational structure, which will transform it into a series of
dispersed but linked events, each focused on different local issues. If
as David Garcia admits, the idea of tactical media grew out of a
specifically Amsterdam context (or perhaps in a wider sense, the
liberal democratic context of the countries of advanced capitalism), it
is commendable that N5M4 is attempting to transcend its origins and
include initiatives that were previously left out of what seemed to be
a primarily 'western' idea of tactical media. The editorial team for
N5M4 includes media tacticians like CAE, members of the Indymedia
network, media centers in post-socialist countries which provide
infrastructural support and access and education to local producers,
and European organizations which provide ICT assistance to groups in
Mali, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Jamaica, and Bolivia. Under the
expanded cover concept of tactical media are included what appear to be
both tactical and strategic media, as well phenomena that differ from
both insofar as they are not forms of warfare - initiatives to provide
infrastructure, improved access, means of communication and exchange to
people who for economic and political reasons are lacking these means.
These modes of production and exchange are not primarily constituted by
being directed against an enemy; the content is not determined in
advance through a preconceived opposition, but left to be shaped by its
producers. Now to my mind, labeling all these diverse practices forms
of 'tactical media' risks missing precisely their differences and
making the term meaningless. This loss of signification seems to
correspond, in inverse proportion, to the recent inflation of 'tactical
media' as a cool label on the market of ideas. Instead of analyzing
concretely what is inherent in different forms of media production and
the ideologies they shelter and preserve, the term papers over their
contradictions. Tactical media is good, progressive, alternative, etc.
There is no need to ask questions, its truth already appears
self-evident.<br>
<br>
After making some extremely arrogant, offensive
films of Maoist propaganda during the early 1970s, Godard became
embarrassed. And started making films that had nothing to say. Here
&amp; Elsewhere - we went to Palestine a few years ago, Godard says. To
make a film about the coming revolution. But who is this we, here? Why
did we go there, elsewhere? And why don't here and elsewhere ever
really meet? What do we mean when we use this strange word
'revolution'? It is only when he was old that Godard learned how to ask
questions, stumbling around like a foreigner in a language and a
history he did not possess. Here &amp; Elsewhere, which came out in the
same year as de Certeau's book, occupies no fixed position, moves
towards no preconceived destination, and takes nothing for granted, not
even its own voice. In an era dominated by a politics of the message
(statements, declarations of war, communiqu&eacute;s, demands in the
form of new five year plans), it searches for a politics of the
question.<br>
<br>
The idea of tactical media is the harbinger of a
question both necessary and timely: how is it possible to make media
otherwise, media that expresses its solidarity with the humiliated
thoughts and incomprehensible desires of those who seem doomed to
silence, media that does not mirror the strategic power of the
mainstream by lapsing into a self-certain propaganda identical to
itself and blind to its own history. But the language of tactical media
simultaneously imprisons the idea of a different type of media
production inside a theory of warfare, as a media of opposition,
determined to conquer the enemy. While it is necessary to continue
asking the question and experimenting with media that work in
situations of crisis and adversity, it is also important to know when
to change terrain. As wars rage around us - wars that rationalize the
trafficking in merchandise under the shadow of sublime principles, wars
against terrorism, wars against drugs, wars of information against
information - maybe what we need least is to advertise our practice as
an extension of one or another principle of warfare. When asked to take
sides, for or against, siding with one army or the other, sometimes the
only real answer is not to play the game. This refusal should not be
confused with an exodus, a silent passivity, or a patient resignation.
It is the vigilance of continuing to think, beyond the obvious - of a
third, a fourth, or fifth alternative to the apocalyptic or utopian
sense of the media.<br>
