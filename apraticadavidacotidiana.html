General Introduction<br>
<br>
This essay is part of a continuing investigation of the ways in which
users-commonly assumed to be passive and guided by established
rules-operate. The point is not so much to discuss this elusive yet
fundamental subject as to make such a discussion possible; that is, by
means of inquiries and hypotheses, to indicate pathways for further
research. This goal will be achieved if everyday practices, "ways of
operating" or doing things, no longer appear as merely the obscure
background of social activity, and if a body of theoretical questions,
methods, categories, and perspectives, by penetrating this obscurity,
make it possible to articulate them.<br>
<br>
The examination of such practices does not imply a return to
individuality. The social atomism which over the past three centuries
has served as the historical axiom of social analysis posits an
elementary unit-the individual-on the basis of which groups are
supposed to be formed and to which they are supposed to be always
reducible. This axiom, which has been challenged by more than a century
of sociological, economic, anthropological, and psychoanalytic
research, (although in history that is perhaps no argument) plays no
part in this study. Analysis shows that a relation (always social)
determines its terms, and not the reverse, and that each individual is
a locus in which an incoherent (and often contradictory) plurality of
such relational determinations interact. Moreover, the question at hand
concerns modes of operation or schemata of action, and not directly the
subjects (or persons) who are their authors or vehicles. It concerns an
operational logic whose models may go as far back as the age-old ruses
of fishes and insects that disguise or transform themselves in order to
survive, and which has in any case been concealed by the form of
rationality currently dominant in Western culture. The purpose of this
work is to make explicit the systems of operational combination (les
combinatoires d'operations) which also compose a "culture," and to
bring to light the models of action characteristic of users whose
status as the dominated element in society (a status that does not mean
that they are either passive or docile) is concealed by the euphemistic
term "consumers." Everyday life invents itself by poaching in countless
ways on the property of others.<br>
<br>
1. Consumer production<br>
<br>
Since this work grew out of studies of "popular culture" or marginal
groups,[1] the investigation of everyday practices was first delimited
negatively by the necessity of not locating cultural difference in
groups associated with the "counter-culture"-groups that were already
singled out, often privileged, and already partly absorbed into
folklore-and that were no more than symptoms or indexes. Three further,
positive determinations were particularly important in articulating our
research.<br>
<br>
Usage, or consumption<br>
<br>
Many, often remarkable, works have sought to study the representations
of a society, on the one hand, and its modes of behavior, on the other.
Building on our knowledge of these social phenomena, it seems both
possible and necessary to determine the use to which they are put by
groups or individuals. For example, the analysis of the images
broadcast by television (representation) and of the time spent watching
television (behavior) should be complemented by a study of what the
cultural consumer "makes" or "does" during this time and with these
images. The same goes for the use of urban space, the products
purchased in the supermarket, the stories and legends distributed by
the newspapers, and so on.<br>
<br>
The "making" in question is a production, a Poiesis[2] -but a hidden
one, because it is scattered over areas defined and occupied by systems
of "production" (television, urban development, commerce, etc.), and
because the steadily increasing expansion of these systems no longer
leaves "consumers" any place in which they can indicate what they make
or do with the products of these systems. To a rationalized,
expansionist and at the same time centralized, clamorous, and
spectacular production corresponds another production, called
"consumption." The latter is devious, it is dispersed, but it
insinuates itself everywhere, silently and almost invisibly, because it
does not manifest itself through its own products, but rather through
its ways of using the products imposed by a dominant economic order.<br>
<br>
For instance, the ambiguity that subverted from within the Spanish
colonizers' "success" in imposing their own culture on the indigenous
Indians is well known. Submissive, and even consenting to their
subjection, the Indians nevertheless often made of the rituals,
representations, and laws imposed on them something quite different
from what their conquerors had in mind; they subverted them not by
rejecting or altering them, but by using them with respect to ends and
references foreign to the system they had no choice but to accept. They
were other within the very colonization that outwardly assimilated
them; their use of the dominant social order deflected its power, which
they lacked the means to challenge; they escaped it without leaving it.
The strength of their difference lay in procedures of "consumption." To
a lesser degree, a similar ambiguity creeps into our societies through
the use made by the "common people" of the culture disseminated and
imposed by the elites" producing the language.<br>
<br>
The presence and circulation of a representation (taught by preachers,
educators, and popularizers as the key to socioeconomic advancement)
tells us nothing about what it is for its users. We must first analyze
its manipulation by users who are not its makers. Only then can we
gauge the difference or similarity between the production of the image
and the secondary production hidden in the process of its utilization.<br>
<br>
Our investigation is concerned with this difference. It can use as its
theoretical model the construction of individual sentences with an
established vocabulary and syntax. In linguistics, "performance" and
"competence" are different: the act of speaking (with all the
enunciative strategies that implies) is not reducible to a knowledge of
the language. By adopting the point of view of enunciation-which is the
subject of our study-we privilege the act of speaking; according to
that point of view, speaking operates within the field of a linguistic
system; it effects an appropriation, or reappropriation, of language by
its speakers; it establishes a present relative to a time and place;
and it posits a contract with the other (the interlocutor) in a network
of places and relations. These four characteristics of the speech
act[3] can be found in many other practices (walking, cooking, etc.).
An objective is at least adumbrated by this parallel, which is, as we
shall see, only partly valid. Such an objective assumes that (like the
Indians mentioned above) users make (bricolent) innumerable and
infinitesimal transformations of and within the dominant cultural
economy in order to adapt it to their own interests and their own
rules. We must determine the procedures, bases, effects, and
possibilities of this collective activity.<br>
<br>
The procedures of everyday creativity<br>
<br>
A second orientation of our investigation can be explained by reference
to Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish. In this work, instead of
analyzing the apparatus exercising power (i.e., the localizable,
expansionist, repressive, and legal institutions), Foucault analyzes
the mechanisms (dispositifs) that have sapped the strength of these
institutions and surreptitiously reorganized the functioning of power:
"miniscule" technical procedures acting on and with details,
redistributing a discursive space in order to make it the means of a
generalized "discipline" (surveillance).[4] This approach raises a new
and different set of problems to be investigated. Once again, however,
this "microphysics of power" privileges the productive apparatus (which
produces the "discipline"), even though it discerns in "education" a
system of "repression" and shows how, from the wings as it were, silent
technologies determine or short-circuit institutional stage directions.
If it is true that the grid of "discipline" is everywhere becoming
clearer and more extensive, it is all the more urgent to discover how
an entire society resists being reduced to it, what popular procedures
(also "miniscule" and quotidian) manipulate the mechanisms of
discipline and conform to them only in order to evade them, and
finally, what "ways of operating" form the counterpart, on the
consumer's (or "dominee's"?) side, of the mute processes that organize
the establishment of socioeconomic order.<br>
<br>
These "ways of operating" constitute the innumerable practices by means
of which users reappropriate the space organized by techniques of
sociocultural production. They pose questions at once analogous and
contrary to those dealt with in Foucault's book: analogous, in that the
goal is to perceive and analyze the microbe-like operations
proliferating within technocratic structures and deflecting their
functioning by means of a multitude of "tactics" articulated in the
details of everyday life; contrary, in that the goal is not to make
clearer how the violence of order is transmuted into a disciplinary
technology, but rather to bring to light the clandestine forms taken by
the dispersed, tactical, and makeshift creativity of groups or
individuals already caught in the nets of "discipline:" Pushed to their
ideal limits, these procedures and ruses of consumers compose the
network of an antidiscipline[5] which is the subject of this book.<br>
<br>
The formal structure of practice<br>
<br>
It may be supposed that these operations-multiform and fragmentary,
relative to situations and details, insinuated into and concealed
within devices whose mode of usage they constitute, and thus lacking
their own ideologies or institutions-conform to certain rules. In other
words, there must be a logic of these practices. We are thus confronted
once again by the ancient problem: What is an art or "way of making"?
From the Greeks to Durkheim, a long tradition has sought to describe
with precision the complex (and not at all simple or "impoverished")
rules that could account for these operations.[6] From this point of
view, "popular culture," as well as a whole literature called
"popular,"[7] take on a different aspect: they present themselves
essentially as "arts of making" this or that, i.e., as combinatory or
utilizing modes of consumption. These practices bring into play a
"popular" ratio, a way of thinking invested in a way of acting, an art
of combination which cannot be dissociated from an art of using.<br>
<br>
In order to grasp the formal structure of these practices, I have
carried out two sorts of investigations. The first, more descriptive in
nature, has concerned certain ways of making that were selected
according to their value for the strategy of the analysis, and with a
view to obtaining fairly differentiated variants: readers' practices,
practices related to urban spaces, utilizations of everyday rituals,
re-uses and functions of the memory through the "authorities" that make
possible (or permit) everyday practices, etc. In addition, two related
investigations have tried to trace the intricate forms of the
operations proper to the recompositon of a space (the Croix-Rousse
quarter in Lyons) by familial practices, on the one hand, and on the
other, to the tactics of the art of cooking, which simultaneously
organizes a network of relations, poetic ways of "making do"
(bricolage), and a re-use of marketing structures.[8]<br>
<br>
The second series of investigations has concerned the scientific
literature that might furnish hypotheses allowing the logic of
unselfconscious thought to be taken seriously. Three areas are of
special interest. First, sociologists, anthropologists, and indeed
historians (from E. Goffman to P. Bourdieu, from Mauss to M.
D&Egrave;tienne, from J. Boissevain to E. 0. Laumann) have elaborated a
theory of such practices, mixtures of rituals and makeshifts
(bricolages), manipulations of spaces, operators of networks.[9]
Second, in the wake of J. Fishman's work, the ethnomethodological and
sociolinguistic investigations of H. Garfinkel, W. Labov, H. Sachs, E.
A. Schegloff, and others have described the procedures of everyday
interactions relative to structures of expectation, negotiation, and
improvisation proper to ordinary language.[10]<br>
<br>
Finally, in addition to the semiotics and philosophies of "convention"
(from O. Ducrot to D. Lewis),[11] we must look into the ponderous
formal logics and their extension, in the field of analytical
philosophy, into the domains of action (G. H. von Wright, A. C. Danto,
R. J. Bernstein),[12] time (A. N. Prior, N. Rescher and J.
Urquhart),[13] and modalisation (G. E. Hughes and M. J. Cresswell, A.
R. White).[14] These extensions yield a weighty apparatus seeking to
grasp the delicate layering and plasticity of ordinary language, with
its almost orchestral combinations of logical elements
(temporalization, modalization, injunctions, predicates of action,
etc.) whose dominants are determined in turn by circumstances and
conjunctural demands. An investigation analogous to Chomsky's study of
the oral uses of language must seek to restore to everyday practices
their logical and cultural legitimacy, at least in the sectors-still
very limited-in which we have at our disposal the instruments necessary
to account for them.[15] This kind of research is complicated by the
fact that these practices themselves alternately exacerbate and disrupt
our logics. Its regrets are like those of the poet, and like him, it
struggles against oblivion: "And I forgot the element of chance
introduced by circumstances, calm or haste, sun or cold, dawn or dusk,
the taste of strawberries or abandonment, the half-understood message,
the front page of newspapers, the voice on the telephone, the most
anodyne conversation, the most anonymous man or woman, everything that
speaks, makes noise, passes by, touches us lightly, meets us head
on."[16]<br>
<br>
The marginality of a majority<br>
<br>
These three determinations make possible an exploration of the cultural
field, an exploration defined by an investigative problematics and
punctuated by more detailed inquiries located by reference to
hypotheses that remain to be verified. Such an exploration will seek to
situate the types of operations characterizing consumption in the
framework of an economy, and to discern in these practices of
appropriation indexes of the creativity that flourishes at the very
point where practice ceases to have its own language.<br>
<br>
Marginality is today no longer limited to minority groups, but is
rather massive and pervasive; this cultural activity of the
non-producers of culture, an activity that is unsigned, unreadable, and
unsymbolized, remains the only one possible for all those who
nevertheless buy and pay for the showy products through which a
productivist economy articulates itself. Marginality is becoming
universal. A marginal group has now become a silent majority.<br>
<br>
That does not mean the group is homogeneous. The procedures allowing
the re-use of products are linked together in a kind of obligatory
language, and their functioning is related to social situations and
power relationships. Confronted by images on television, the immigrant
worker does not have the same critical or creative elbow-room as the
average citizen. On the same terrain, his inferior access to
information, financial means, and compensations of all kinds elicits an
increased deviousness, fantasy, or laughter. Similar strategic
deployments, when acting on different relationships of force, do not
produce identical effects. Hence the necessity of differentiating both
the "actions" or "engagements" (in the military sense) that the system
of products effects within the consumer grid, and the various kinds of
room to maneuver left for consumers by the situations in which they
exercise their "art."<br>
<br>
The relation of procedures to the fields of force in which they act
must therefore lead to a polemological analysis of culture. Like law
(one of its models), culture articulates conflicts and alternately
legitimizes, displaces, or controls the superior force. It develops in
an atmosphere of tensions, and often of violence, for which it provides
symbolic balances, contracts of compatibility and compromises, all more
or less temporary. The tactics of consumption, the ingenious ways in
which the weak make use of the strong, thus lend a political dimension
to everyday practices.<br>
<br>
2. The tactics of practice<br>
<br>
In the course of our research, the scheme, rather too neatly
dichotomized, of the relations between consumers and the mechanisms of
production has been diversified in relation to three kinds of concerns:
the search for a problematics that could articulate the material
collected; the description of a limited number of practices (reading,
talking, walking, dwelling, cooking, etc.) considered to be
particularly significant; and the extension of the analysis of these
everyday operations to scientific fields apparently governed by another
kind of logic. Through the presentation of our investigation along
these three lines, the overly schematic character of the general
statement can be somewhat nuanced.<br>
<br>
Trajectories, tactics, and rhetorics<br>
<br>
As unrecognized producers, poets of their own acts, silent discoverers
of their own paths in the jungle of functionalist rationality,
consumers produce through their signifying practices something that
might be considered similar to the "wandering lines" ("lignes derre")
drawn by the autistic children studied by F. Deligny[17]: "indirect" or
"errant" trajectories obeying their own logic. In the technocratically
constructed, written, and functionalized space in which the consumers
move about, their trajectories form unforeseeable sentences, partly
unreadable paths across a space. Although they are composed with the
vocabularies of established languages (those of television, newspapers,
supermarkets, or museum sequences) and although they remain
subordinated to the prescribed syntactical forms (temporal modes of
schedules, paradigmatic orders of spaces, etc.), the trajectories trace
out the ruses of other interests and desires that are neither
determined nor captured by the systems in which they develop.[18]<br>
<br>
Even statistical investigation remains virtually ignorant of these
trajectories, since it is satisfied with classifying, calculating, and
putting into tables the "lexical" units which compose them but to which
they cannot be reduced, and with doing this in reference to its own
categories and taxonomies. Statistical investigation grasps the
material of these practices, but not their form; it determines the
elements used, but not the "phrasing" produced by the bricolage (the
artisan-like inventiveness) and the discursiveness that combine these
elements, which are all in general circulation and rather drab.
Statistical inquiry, in breaking down these "efficacious meanderings"
into units that it defines itself, in reorganizing the results of its
analyses according to its own codes, "finds" only the homogenous. The
power of its calculations ties in its ability to divide, but it is
precisely through this analytic fragmentation that it loses sight of
what it claims to seek and to represent.[19]<br>
<br>
"Trajectory" suggests a movement, but it also involves a plane
projection, a flattening out. It is a transcription. A graph (which the
eye can master) is substituted for an operation; a line which can be
reversed (i.e., read in both directions) does duty for an irreversible
temporal series, a tracing for acts. To avoid this reduction, I resort
to a distinction between tactics and strategies.<br>
<br>
I call a "strategy" the calculus of force-relationships which becomes
possible when a subject of will and power (a proprietor, an enterprise,
a city, a scientific institution) can be isolated from an
"environment." A strategy assumes a place that can be circumscribed as
proper (propre) and thus serve as the basis for generating relations
with an exterior distinct from it (competitors, adversaries,
"clienteles," "targets," or "objects" of research). Political,
economic, and scientific rationality has been constructed on this
strategic model.<br>
<br>
I call a "tactic," on the other hand, a calculus which cannot count on
a "proper" (a spatial or institutional localization), nor thus on a
borderline distinguishing the other as a visible totality. The place of
a tactic belongs to the other.[20] A tactic insinuates itself into the
other's place, fragmentarily, without taking it over in its entirety,
without being able to keep it at a distance. It has at its disposal no
base where it can capitalize on its advantages, prepare its expansions,
and secure independence with respect to circumstances. The "proper" is
a victory of space over time. On the contrary, because it does not have
a place, a tactic depends on time-it is always on the watch for
opportunities that must be seized "on the wing." Whatever it wins, it
does not keep. It must constantly manipulate events in order to turn
them into "opportunities." The weak must continually turn to their own
ends forces alien to them. This is achieved in the propitious moments
when they are able to combine heterogeneous elements (thus, in the
supermarket, the housewife confronts heterogeneous and mobile data-what
she has in the refrigerator, the tastes, appetites, and moods of her
guests, the best buys and their possible combinations with what she
already has on hand at home, etc.); the intellectual synthesis of these
given elements takes the form, however, not of a discourse, but of the
decision itself, the act and manner in which the opportunity is
"seized."<br>
<br>
Many everyday practices (talking, reading, moving about, shopping,
cooking, etc.) are tactical in character. And so are, more generally,
many "ways of operating": victories of the "weak" over the "strong"
(whether the strength be that of powerful people or the violence of
things or of an imposed order, etc.), clever tricks, knowing how to get
away with things, "hunter's cunning," maneuvers, polymorphic
simulations, joyful discoveries, poetic as well as warlike. The Greeks
called these "ways of operating" metis.[21] But they go much further
back, to the immemorial intelligence displayed in the tricks and
imitations of plants and fishes. From the depths of the ocean to the
streets of modern megalopolises, there is a continuity and permanence
in these tactics.<br>
<br>
In our societies, as local stabilities break down, it is as if, no
longer fixed by a circumscribed community, tactics wander out of orbit,
making consumers into immigrants in a system too vast to be their own,
too tightly woven for them to escape from it. But these tactics
introduce a Brownian movement into the system. They also show the
extent to which intelligence is inseparable from the everyday struggles
and pleasures that it articulates. Strategies, in contrast, conceal
beneath objective calculations their connection with the power that
sustains them from within the stronghold of its own "proper" place or
institution.<br>
<br>
The discipline of rhetoric offers models for differentiating among the
types of tactics. This is not surprising, since, on the one hand, it
describes the "turns" or tropes of which language can be both the site
and the object, and, on the other hand, these manipulations are related
to the ways of changing (seducing, persuading, making use of) the will
of another (the audience).[22] For these two reasons, rhetoric, the
science of the "ways of speaking," offers an array of figure-types for
the analysis of everyday ways of acting even though such analysis is in
theory excluded from scientific discourse. Two logics of action (the
one tactical, the other strategic) arise from these two facets of
practicing language. In the space of a language (as in that of games),
a society makes more explicit the formal rules of action and the
operations that differentiate them.<br>
<br>
In the enormous rhetorical corpus devoted to the art of speaking or
operating, the Sophists have a privileged place, from the point of view
of tactics. Their principle was, according to the Greek rhetorician
Corax, to make the weaker position seem the stronger, and they claimed
to have the power of turning the tables on the powerful by the way in
which they made use of the opportunities offered by the particular
situation.[23] Moreover, their theories inscribe tactics in a long
tradition of reflection on the relationships between reason and
particular actions and situations. Passing by way of The Art of War by
the Chinese author Sun Tzu[24] or the Arabic anthology, The Book of
Tricks,[25] this tradition of a logic articulated on situations and the
will of others continues into contemporary sociolinguistics.<br>
<br>
Reading, talking, dwelling, cooking, etc.<br>
<br>
To describe these everyday practices that produce without capitalizing,
that is, without taking control over time, one starting point seemed
inevitable because it is the "exorbitant" focus of contemporary culture
and its consumption: reading. From TV to newspapers, from advertising
to all sorts of mercantile epiphanies, our society is characterized by
a cancerous growth of vision, measuring . everything by its ability to
show or be shown and transmuting communication into a visual journey.
It is a sort of epic of the eye and of the impulse to read. The economy
itself, transformed into a "semeiocracy"[26], encourages a hypertrophic
development of reading. Thus, for the binary set
production-consumption, one would substitute its more general
equivalent: writing-reading. Reading (an image or a text), moreover,
seems to constitute the maximal development of the passivity assumed to
characterize the consumer, who is conceived of as a voyeur (whether
trogiodytic or itinerant) in a "show biz society."[27]<br>
<br>
In reality, the activity of reading has on the contrary all the
characteristics of a silent production: the drift across the page, the
metamorphosis of the text effected by the wandering eyes of the reader,
the improvisation and expectation of meanings inferred from a few
words, leaps over written spaces in an ephemeral dance. But since he is
incapable of stockpiling (unless he writes or records), the reader
cannot protect himself against the erosion of time (while reading, he
forgets himself and he forgets what he has read) unless he buys the
object (book, image) which is no more than a substitute (the spoor or
promise) of moments 'lost" in reading. He insinuates into another
person's text the ruses of pleasure and appropriation: he poaches on
it, is transported into it, pluralizes himself in it like the internal
rumblings of one's body. Ruse, metaphor, arrangement, this production
is also an "invention" of the memory. Words become the outlet or
product of silent histories. The readable transforms itself into the
memorable: Barthes reads Proust in Stendhal's text;[28] the viewer
reads the landscape of his childhood in the evening news. The thin film
of writing becomes a movement of strata, a play of spaces. A different
world (the reader's) slips into the author's place.<br>
<br>
This mutation makes the text habitable, like a rented apartment. It
transforms another person's property into a space borrowed for a moment
by a transient. Renters make comparable changes in an apartment they
furnish with their acts and memories; as do speakers, in the language
into which they insert both the messages of their native tongue and,
through their accent, through their own "turns of phrase," etc., their
own history; as do pedestrians, in the streets they fill with the
forests of their desires and goals. In the same way the users of social
codes turn them into metaphors and ellipses of their own quests. The
ruling order serves as a support for innumerable productive activities,
while at the same time blinding its proprietors to this creativity
(like those "bosses" who simply can't see what is being created within
their own enterprises).[29] Carried to its limit, this order would be
the equivalent of the rules of meter and rhyme for poets of earlier
times: a body of constraints stimulating new discoveries, a set of
rules with which improvisation plays.<br>
<br>
Reading thus introduces an "art" which is anything but passive. It
resembles rather that art whose theory was developed by medieval poets
and romancers: an innovation infiltrated into the text and even into
the terms of a tradition. Imbricated within the strategies of modernity
(which identify creation with the invention of a personal language,
whether cultural or scientific), the procedures of contemporary
consumption appear to constitute a subtle art of "renters" who know how
to insinuate their countless differences into the dominant text. In the
Middle Ages, the text was framed by the four, or seven, interpretations
of which it was held to be susceptible. And it was a book. Today, this
text no longer comes from a tradition. It is imposed by the generation
of a productivist technocracy. It is no longer a referential book, but
a whole society made into a book, into the writing of the anonymous law
of production.<br>
<br>
It is useful to compare other arts with this art of readers. For
example, the art of conversationalists: the rhetoric of ordinary
conversation consists of practices which transform "speech situations,"
verbal productions in which the interlacing of speaking positions
weaves an oral fabric without individual owners, creations of a
communication that belongs to no one. Conversation is a provisional and
collective effect of competence in the art of manipulating
"commonplaces" and the inevitability of events in such a way as to make
them "habitable"[30]<br>
<br>
But our research has concentrated above all on the uses of space,[31]
on the ways of frequenting or dwelling in a place, on the complex
processes of the art of cooking, and on the many ways of establishing a
kind of reliability within the situations imposed on an individual,
that is, of making it possible to live in them by reintroducing into
them the plural mobility of goals and desires-an art of manipulating
and enjoying.[32]<br>
<br>
Extensions: prospects and politics<br>
<br>
The analysis of these tactics was extended to two areas marked out for
study, although our approach to them changed as the research proceeded:
the first concerns prospects, or futurology, and the second, the
individual subject in political life.<br>
<br>
The "scientific" character of futurology poses a problem from the very
start. If the objective of such research is ultimately to establish the
intelligibility of present reality, and its rules as they reflect a
concern for coherence, we must recognize, on the one hand, the
nonfunctional status of an increasing number of concepts, and on the
other, the inadequacy of procedures for thinking about, in our case,
space. Chosen here as an object of study, space is not really
accessible through the usual political and economic determinations;
besides, futurology provides no theory of space.[33] The
metaphorization of the concepts employed, the gap between the
atomization characteristic of research and the generalization required
in reporting it, etc., suggest that we take as a definition of
futurological discourse the "simulation" that characterizes its method.<br>
<br>
Thus in futurology we must consider: (1) the relations between a
certain kind of rationality and an imagination (which is in discourse
the mark of the locus of its production); (2) the difference between,
on the one hand, the tentative moves, pragmatic ruses, and successive
tactics that mark the stages of practical investigation and, on the
other hand, the strategic representations offered to the public as the
product of these operations.[34]<br>
<br>
In current discussions, one can discern the surreptitious return of a
rhetoric that metaphorizes the fields "proper" to scientific analysis,
while, in research laboratories, one finds an increasing distance
between actual everyday practices (practices of the same order as the
art of cooking) and the "scenarios" that punctuate with utopian images
the hum of operations in every laboratory: on the one hand, mixtures of
science and fiction; on the other, a disparity between the spectacle of
overall strategies and the opaque reality of local tactics. We are thus
led to inquire into the "underside" of scientific activity and to ask
whether it does not function as a collage-juxtaposing, but linking less
and less effectively, the theoretical ambitions of the discourse with
the stubborn persistence of ancient tricks in the everyday work of
agencies and laboratories. In any event, this split structure,
observable in so many administrations and companies, requires us to
rethink all the tactics which have so far been neglected by the
epistemology of science.<br>
<br>
The question bears on more than the procedures of production: in a
different form, it concerns as well the status of the individual in
technical systems, since the involvement of the subject diminishes in
proportion to the technocratic expansion of these systems. Increasingly
constrained, yet less and less concerned with these vast frameworks,
the individual detaches himself from them without being able to escape
them and can henceforth only try to outwit them, to pull tricks on
them, to rediscover, within an electronicized and computerized
megalopolis, the "art" of the hunters and rural folk of earlier days.
The fragmentation of the social fabric today lends a political
dimension to the problem of the subject. In support of this claim can
be adduced the symptoms represented by individual conflicts and local
operations, and even by ecological organizations, though these are
preoccupied primarily with the effort to control relations with the
environment collectively. These ways of reappropriating the
product-system, ways created by consumers, have as their goal a
therapeutics for deteriorating social relations and make use of
techniques of re-employment in which we can recognize the procedures of
everyday practices. A politics of such ploys should be developed. In
the perspective opened up by Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents,
such a politics should also inquire into the public ("democratic")
image of the microscopic, multiform, and innumerable connections
between manipulating and enjoying, the fleeting and massive reality of
a social activity at play with the order that contains it.<br>
<br>
Witold Gombrowicz, an acute visionary, gave this politics its herothe
anti-hero who haunts our research-when he gave a voice to the
small-time official (Musil's "man without qualities" or that ordinary
man to whom Freud dedicated Civilization and Its Discontents) whose
refrain is "When one does not have what one wants, one must want what
one has": "I have had, you see, to resort more and more to very small,
almost invisible pleasures, little extras.... You've no idea how great
one becomes with these little details, it's incredible how one
grows."[35]<br>
